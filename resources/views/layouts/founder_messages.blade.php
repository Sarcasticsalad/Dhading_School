                At Sifal School, we take a holistic approach to education. While we strive for excellence in academics, our mission extends beyond that: We teach our students the soft and hard skills they need to become confident and curious citizens of the world.

                We focus on reading, writing and coding. Reading a range of texts — fiction, non-fiction, poetry and beyond — helps students expand their vocabularies and become clearer thinkers and writers.

                Reading and writing skills go hand-in-hand. Students use what they’ve learned from reading to further hone their analytical and creative writing skills and become better communicators.

                Coding teaches students the art of problem-solving and acquaints them with the technologies of the future — skills that will be key regardless of the career paths they choose.

                Our educators recognize the moment: The pace of technological change is accelerating, and today’s students will need to be prepared for an increasingly unpredictable future. Our goal is to give them the skills and the tools to take on new challenges with intellect, agility and humanity.

                I bring a wealth of experience in Information Technology (IT) to my role as School Principal, holding an MTech degree from Kathmandu University's School of Engineering and benefiting from the Erasmus Mundus Scholarship for advanced studies in Italy.

                 Recognized for my commitment to educational progress, I also received the IVLP Fellowship in the USA, enriching my understanding of digital education. Over my decade-long tenure at Deerwalk, I've championed technology's impact on education,
