                At Sifal School, we take a holistic approach to education. While we strive for excellence in academics, our mission extends beyond that: We teach our students the soft and hard skills they need to become confident and curious citizens of the world.

                We focus on reading, writing and coding. Reading a range of texts — fiction, non-fiction, poetry and beyond — helps students expand their vocabularies and become clearer thinkers and writers.

                Reading and writing skills go hand-in-hand. Students use what they’ve learned from reading to further hone their analytical and creative writing skills and become better communicators.

                Coding teaches students the art of problem-solving and acquaints them with the technologies of the future — skills that will be key regardless of the career paths they choose.

                Our educators recognize the moment: The pace of technological change is accelerating, and today’s students will need to be prepared for an increasingly unpredictable future. Our goal is to give them the skills and the tools to take on new challenges with intellect, agility and humanity.

                With a robust background in Information Technology (IT) and my current role as a dedicated School Principal, I bring a blend of expertise to our educational journey. I hold a Master of Technology (MTech) degree in IT from Kathmandu University's esteemed School of Engineering. Additionally, I had the privilege of receiving the prestigious Erasmus Mundus Scholarship, which allowed me to pursue advanced studies at Politecnico di Torino in Italy, broadening my understanding of global IT landscapes.

In recognition of my expertise and commitment to educational advancement, I was honored with the IVLP (International Visitor Leadership Program) Fellowship by the Department of States. This fellowship provided me with invaluable insights into Education in the Digital Age during my enlightening tenure in the United States.

My professional journey spans over a decade at Deerwalk, during which I have made significant contributions to the field. I am deeply passionate about leveraging technology's transformative potential in modern education, a journey that fuels my enthusiasm for fostering excellence and growth in academic settings.

I look forward to partnering with you in nurturing the academic, social, and emotional growth of every student at Deerwalk Dhading School.
